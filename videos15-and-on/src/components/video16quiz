1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
My answer: React is a framework that makes it possible to reuse html in a more code-readable way. Part of this is hiding the code for the framework itself in another file, so we would need to import it.

Right answer: React is what defines JSX (so I got this one right)

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
My answer: Object[object]

Right answer: the contents of the react object (so I got this one wrong)

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
My answer: A react object cannot have separate tags. Multiple tags would need to be included in one unifying tag.

Right answer: We need our JSX to be nested under a single parent element.

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
My answer: declarative is when directions are laid out in exhaustive detail. imperative is when you give some instructions but exactly how to execute them is not included.

Right answer: declarative is when you give some instructions but exactly how to execute them is not included. Impierative is when directions are laid out in exhaustive detail (so I got this wrong)

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
My answer: composable is when you can reuse a block of code by referencing it with a variable name.

Right answer: We have small pieces that we can put together to make something larger/greater than the individual pieces (I sorta got this right)
